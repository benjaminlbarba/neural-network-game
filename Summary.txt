Final Project Team 65


--------------
Overview
--------------

In light of the Blackjack Solitaire game that we designed in project 3, our group developed a 2-dimensional Pac-Man game, in which the player controls Pac-Man, who must eat all the "dots" and avoid the "ghosts" within a enclosed maze. If Pac-Man makes contact with the ghosts, he will lose a life and the game ends if Pac-Man loses all his lives.

The final 2D arcade maze game features multiple states within the structure. Each state renders a different levels when player advances through the game, as well as the gameover and high score functionalities.
